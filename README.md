Hey there, welcome to my submission for Partify's form submission. Users are able to enter their own inputs into a form, and receive possible responses from the data provided, from which the program will go through the main partify site.
1. User can enter year, make, model, and product type and figure out which products are available.
2. Products which arent available will appear as such and user will be prompted to enter a valid entry.
3. If input is valid, user will be directed to the main partify site with the page returned.

Alternate Methods:
1. Users can submit their own data set to the partify site by adding it into the data folder, which will be parsed by node.js to constantly update information if needed.

2.Newly created data parsed from the excel file will be used for the form submission and allow users to select from existing data.
